# CentOS 7 Docker Vagrant

All the necessary ingredients to build a Docker image for use with
Vagrant.

The main aim here is to make something that will work with Vagrant with
Docker as a drop-in replacement for VirtualBox/vagrant-lxc.

If all you want to do is use this, you can just download the Vagrantfile
and run `vagrant up --provider=docker`
